"""Hatch build hook: write _build_info.py + package the man-page markdown.

Bakes git metadata (commit, branch, tag, dirty flag, timestamp) into the
wheel so `brew-hop-search -V` can report the exact commit of any install,
not just dev-tree ones. Also copies docs/brew-hop-search.1.md into
src/brew_hop_search/data/ so `brew-hop-search --man` works post-install.
