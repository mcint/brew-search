# cache-flow

Offline-first read path: respond from cache immediately, refresh in
background, hold the terminal until the bg refresh finishes (or `^C`).

## Purpose

Make `bhs <query>`, `bhs -i`, and `bhs -O` feel instant on repeated use,
even hours or days later. The cache is the primary source of truth at
read time; the network is a *post-print* concern.

The shape: `(invoke) → (issue local + remote in parallel) → (print local
results, flush) → (notify if stale, hold open terminal) → (print update
duration, notify if remote differs) → (exit)`.

## Input

This isn't a flag — it's the default behavior for **search**, **`-i`**,
**`-O`**. Existing flags continue to apply:

- `--refresh[=DUR]` / `--fresh[=DUR]` (alias) — force or conditional
  *foreground* refresh (legacy behavior; pre-empts cache-first)
- `--refresh=KIND[,KIND...]` — refresh a subset only; KIND ∈
  `{index, installed, outdated, taps, local, all}` (see `--refresh` below)
- `--stale DUR` — override the threshold beyond which a cache is
  considered stale enough to background-refresh
- `-L` / `--local` — *no* network, no background refresh; pure cache
- `-q` / `--quiet` — disables the trailing status line (results only)

### `--refresh` selector

Bare `--refresh` and `--refresh=DUR` keep their existing meaning. The
new comma-separated form picks which sources to act on:

```
--refresh                # force-refresh whichever sources this command touches
--refresh=index          # API formulae+casks only
--refresh=installed      # rerun `brew info --json=v2 --installed`
--refresh=index,installed
--refresh=all            # everything: index, installed, taps, local
--refresh=6h             # legacy: refresh if older than 6h (any KIND that's stale)
```

Parser rule: if the value matches `^[0-9]+[smhd]?(.*)?$` it's a duration;
otherwise it's a comma-separated KIND list. Mixing
(`--refresh=installed,6h`) is rejected with a clear error.

### `--refresh=KIND` as a standalone command

`bhs --refresh=KIND[,...]` with no query and no source flag is a
*"load these caches"* invocation: each requested kind is refreshed
sequentially, a one-line status (`# [cache] taps  ✓ 0.3s`) is printed
to stderr per kind, and the process exits. `-v` adds a `# [cache]
total Xs` footer.

```
bhs --refresh=all          # warm everything in one go
bhs --refresh=taps         # rescan local taps only
bhs --refresh=index,local  # API + offline cache
```

This is distinct from `bhs --refresh foo` (force-refresh whatever
sources `foo`'s search touches, then print results). Without a query
or source flag, `--refresh=DUR` and bare `--refresh` still fall
through to the usage hint — those forms are modifiers, not commands.

When combined with a query or source flag, `--refresh=KIND` is also
honored for kinds that the invocation wouldn't otherwise touch:
`bhs --refresh=taps foo` runs the API search for `foo` *and* refreshes
the taps cache as a side effect. (Previously, the explicit kind was
silently ignored unless the matching source flag was also set.)

**Future direction (not yet implemented):** per-kind durations in one
invocation (`--refresh=local:5m,taps:5s`) are intentionally still
rejected by the parser. Different TTLs require separate invocations
today; the syntax is a deliberate spec change that will need its own
precedence rules vs `--stale`, env vars, and config defaults.

**Future direction:** parallel refresh with return-fast semantics
(`bhs --refresh=all &` style without the `&`) — kick off every
refresh, return control immediately, print completion lines async.
Today the standalone command is sequential and blocking.

## Output

### The trailing status line

After the result body is printed and stdout is flushed, the next
behavior depends on whether a background refresh is in flight.

**No bg refresh** (cache fresh enough, `-L`, or refresh skipped): no
trailing line. Exit immediately.

**Bg refresh in flight**, TTY:

```
  python  3.13.2  Interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language  │ ...
  …  [more results]
  # [cache] updating index … (^C to skip)
```

The `# [cache] updating <kinds> …` line is written to stderr in dim
color. When the bg refresh completes, the line is overwritten in place
with one of:

- `# [cache] index ✓ matches cache  (1.2s)` — refresh ran, results
  unchanged
- `# [cache] index ↻ updated, results may differ — re-run  (1.2s)` —
  refresh ran, top-N results differ from what was just printed
- `# [cache] index ✗ refresh failed (network: …)  (8.3s)` — refresh
  errored; cached results were still served

`<kinds>` is comma-joined (`index`, `installed`, `outdated`); typically
just one for search and `-i`, two for `-O` if both `index` and
`installed` are stale.

**Bg refresh in flight**, non-TTY: no status line at all. The bg
process is still launched and detached, but the terminal returns
immediately so `bhs … | grep …` doesn't block.

### Differs/matches detection

The "matches cache" / "may differ" determination compares the **set of
top-N (name, version) tuples** that were just printed against the same
query re-evaluated against the freshly-refreshed cache. If the tuple
list is identical (order included), report `matches`. Otherwise report
`may differ` — without re-printing, since the user can just re-run.

For `-i`, the comparison is `set(installed names + versions)` — we don't
care about ordering for the installed list.

For `-O`, the comparison is `set((name, current_version))` of the
outdated list.

### Timing

Wall-clock duration of the bg refresh is recorded and printed in the
trailing line. Additionally:

- At `-v`: also log to stderr `# [cache] timing  index=1.2s`
- At `-vv`: log per-step `# [cache] timing  fetch=0.9s parse=0.2s
  index=0.1s`
- Always: append a row to `~/.cache/brew-hop-search/refresh.log` with
  `<iso-timestamp>\t<kind>\t<duration_ms>\t<ok|fail>` for later
  analysis. Caps at 1MB (truncate-oldest on rotation).

### `^C` during the trailing line

When the user `^C`s while the trailing line is held open, the bg
process is **not** killed (it owns its own session via
`start_new_session=True` already). The CLI exits cleanly with exit
code 0. The next invocation will pick up the refreshed cache when the
bg job finishes on its own.

## Cache decision matrix

| State                        | -L  | search default                        | --refresh             | --refresh=KIND        |
|------------------------------|-----|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Fresh cache                  | use | use, no bg                            | sync refresh, then print | sync refresh selected; print |
| Stale cache (age > stale)    | use | print cache, bg refresh, trailing line | sync refresh, then print | sync refresh selected; print |
| No cache                     | err | sync refresh, then print              | sync refresh, then print | sync refresh selected, then print |

*"Sync refresh, then print"* keeps the existing first-run UX — there's
nothing to print until the cache exists.

## `-i` specifics

- `-i` always serves from cache when the cache exists, regardless of
  age, by default.
- The `brew info --json=v2 --installed` foreground call is bumped from
  60s to **300s** when run as a background refresh — slow brew
  invocations no longer block the user.
- `--refresh=installed` (or bare `--refresh` while `-i` is active) reverts
  to the synchronous behavior.
- Cache-stale threshold for `-i` is `STALE_INSTALLED` (default 1h).

## `-O` specifics

- `-O` reads the existing `formula`, `cask`, `installed_*` caches
  without forcing refresh. If both index and installed are within their
  stale windows, `-O` is fully offline.
- If either is stale, the relevant kinds are bg-refreshed after the
  outdated list prints. Trailing status reports `<kinds>` accordingly.
- `--brew-verify` keeps its current synchronous behavior — by user
  intent it's the slow, authoritative path.

## `-C` specifics

The cache-status display gains a "ttl" column showing the threshold at
which each source will be considered stale on the next read:

```
  formula  8306  1h12m ago  ttl 6h        fts  30MB json
  cask     7596  1h12m ago  ttl 6h        fts  14MB json
  installed:f  460  1h11m ago  ttl 1h
```

At `-v`, append the resolution layer (`default` / `env` / `config`):

```
  formula  8306  1h12m ago  ttl 6h (default)        fts  30MB json
  installed:f  460  1h11m ago  ttl 2s (env: BREW_HOP_SEARCH_STALE_INSTALLED)
```

At `-vv`, add the next-refresh ETA:

```
  formula  8306  1h12m ago  ttl 6h (default)  fresh for 4h47m  fts  30MB json
```

## Examples

```sh
# Default behavior — answer from cache, refresh in background.
brew-hop-search python                      # search
brew-hop-search -i                          # installed
brew-hop-search -O                          # outdated

# Pure offline (no network, no bg refresh).
brew-hop-search -L python
brew-hop-search -i -L

# Force refresh, then print fresh results.
brew-hop-search --refresh python            # all sources this command touches
brew-hop-search --refresh=installed -i      # just `brew info` rerun
brew-hop-search --refresh=index,installed -O

# Test 1-second TTLs (12-factor):
BREW_HOP_SEARCH_STALE_API=1s brew-hop-search python

# Quiet pipeline use — no trailing status line, no bg blocking.
brew-hop-search -q python | fzf
```

## Implementation Notes

- The bg refresh is already non-blocking in `api.background_refresh`
  (`subprocess.Popen` with `start_new_session=True`). The new piece is
  the **trailing status thread** that polls a sentinel file written by
  the bg process on completion.
- Sentinel mechanism: bg process writes
  `~/.cache/brew-hop-search/.refresh-<kind>.done` (with duration + ok
  flag) at end of run. Foreground process polls for this file until
  it appears or `^C`. Default poll interval 100ms; cap wait at the
  bg process's expected timeout (e.g. 300s for installed).
- The "results may differ" comparison runs the same `search()` call a
  second time after refresh and diffs the (name, version) tuples. Cost
  is one extra FTS query; negligible.
- Quiet mode (`-q`) and non-TTY runs short-circuit the trailing line
  entirely but still launch the bg refresh.

## Spec status

**Specced:** offline-first read path, trailing status line semantics,
`--refresh=KIND` selector, `-C` ttl column, env-var TTL overrides
(landed separately in `defaults.py`).

**Not yet repaved:** the bg-refresh sentinel file mechanism described
above is the working plan; if implementation finds a cleaner approach
(e.g. a shared SQLite "refresh_progress" table), this spec is updated
to match before the implementation lands.
